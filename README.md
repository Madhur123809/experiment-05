Aim:
The aim of this experiment is to design, implement, and analyze the given program using a structured algorithm. The objective is to understand the working principle of the program, verify its correctness, and study its output for the given inputs.

Theory:
An algorithm is a finite sequence of well-defined steps used to solve a problem. In programming, algorithms are converted into programs using a programming language such as Python. Python is a high-level, interpreted language known for its simplicity, readability, and wide range of applications.
In this experiment, the program follows a logical sequence where:
Variables are declared and initialized
Inputs are taken (if required)
Logical operations or conditions are applied
Required computations are performed
Output is displayed to the user
Understanding the theory behind the program helps in debugging, optimizing, and extending the code for real-world applications. Such programs are widely used in data processing, automation, and engineering problem-solving.
Algorithm:
1.Start the program

2.Define and initialize required variables

3.Accept input values from the user (if applicable)

4.Apply the given logic step by step

5.Perform calculations or operations as required

6.Store intermediate results (if any)

7.Display the final output

8.Stop the program
